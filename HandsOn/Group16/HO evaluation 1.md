    Analysis
        - The resource naming strategy is missing.
    Ontology
        - The domain and/or range of some property is not defined.
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
        - Some classes in the ontology are disconnected from the others.
    RDF data
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
