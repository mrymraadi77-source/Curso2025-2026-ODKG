    Ontology
        - The ontology file is not a valid Turtle file.
        - The XML schema datatypes start with lowercase.
        - Can you send me the diagram of the ontology in Chowlk?
    RDF data
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - Add labels to districts.
        - You can add datatypes to WKT data.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
